# users-project
A simple example for user management. 

Using React and Dotnet core web api

To start project:

1] Start api: 
  Go to user-api folder and execute "dotnet run" command  

2] Start React App:
  Go to user-ui folder and execute "npm start" command
  
  
  

Future improvements:


Sort, Filter, Pagination, Search functionality on the user list page.
Validation for email address format, password pattern and strenth, Required fields validation.
Store Password in hashed and salted format.

For sort and filter, I will add any of the data grid library like Material UI or AgGrid
For pagination, I will need to modify the api the accept offset and limit params
For validation, I will user some predefined validation attributes and regex.
